# Rock-Paper-Scissors-with-Hand-Gestures
This project brings a modern twist to the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game by using hand gesture recognition through a webcam. Instead of clicking buttons, players show their moves—rock (fist), paper (open palm), or scissors (two fingers)—in front of the camera, and the system recognizes the gesture to play the game.

Using real-time video input, the program detects the player’s hand gesture and matches it against a randomly chosen move by the computer. It then compares both choices and determines the result—win, lose, or draw—instantly.

This interactive game not only demonstrates basic game logic but also integrates computer vision and gesture recognition to create a more immersive experience. It’s a great way to explore how AI and image processing can enhance simple applications.

Features:
Real-time hand gesture detection using a webcam

Automatic comparison of player and computer moves

Immediate display of results with feedback

Fun and intuitive hands-free gameplay

Technologies Used:
Python 3.12

OpenCV for video capture and image processing

Mediapipe (or custom logic) for hand tracking and gesture recognition

This project is ideal for beginners in computer vision or anyone looking to add a creative twist to a familiar game.
